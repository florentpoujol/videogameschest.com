VGC is a discovery engine for games, devs, and game dev tools.
It's a database of simple profiles you can search with multiple criteria.

Profiles holds these infos : name, description, medias (list of links to screenshots and videos), links (links to website, stores, ...), and tags.
Tags are any criteria relevant to describe and categorize the profile. It may be about the OS, engine, device, graphical look, nb of players, languages, stores, country, name of dev, price range...

Users may come to the website and browse its profiles.
They may search words inside the name and description or search for any tags.
They may sort the list of profiles by date added, relase date, price?

The profiles are added automatically by crawlers that can read a web page, extract information and create/prefill a profile.
The profiles needs to be completed and made public by a human admin.
An RSS reader system can suggest links to articles o other DB profiles.
Users can suggest any links too.
